    <p class="lead text-center">
        QuickFlicks is your personal movie organiser – a quick and simple way to
        save films, track what you’ve watched, and decide what to watch next.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">What the Site Does</h2>
    <p>
        QuickFlicks lets you keep your own movie shelves:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Put Away</strong> – recently added films waiting to be sorted.</li>
        <li><strong>To Watch</strong> – films you plan to watch soon.</li>
        <li><strong>Watched</strong> – films you’ve already seen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Every film can also be rated with a 👍, 👎, or left unrated. Your shelves update
        automatically based on the choices you make.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">How to Add a Movie</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the search bar at the top of the homepage.</li>
        <li>Search for a film using a title or keyword.</li>
        <li>Choose a movie from the results and click <strong>Add to Shelf</strong>.</li>
        <li>The film will appear on your <strong>To Put Away</strong> shelf.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="mt-4">How to Organise Your Shelves</h2>
    <p>You can move movies between shelves using the buttons provided:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Move to To Watch</strong> – puts the movie on your watchlist.</li>
        <li><strong>Move to Watched</strong> – moves the movie to your watched list.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove from Shelf</strong> – removes the movie entirely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Rating Movies</h2>
    <p>
        After watching a film, you can rate it:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>👍 Like</strong></li>
        <li><strong>👎 Dislike</strong></li>
        <li><strong>—</strong> No rating (default)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Ratings appear in the admin panel too, helping you keep track of what you enjoy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">User Accounts & Admin</h2>
    <p>
        QuickFlicks includes a secure authentication system so users can create accounts
        and manage their own movie shelves. Admin users have access to the Django admin
        dashboard where they can manage movies, users, and permissions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        The site has been designed with accessibility in mind, including ARIA labels,
        keyboard-friendly buttons, readable contrast, and clear visual feedback.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Why This Project Exists</h2>
    <p>
        QuickFlicks was created as part of a Full-Stack Web Development milestone project.
        It focuses on database relationships, CRUD functionality, Django admin
        customisation, and backend logic.
