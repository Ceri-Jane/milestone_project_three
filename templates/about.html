    <p class="lead text-center">
        QuickFlicks is your personal movie organiser – a quick and simple way to
        save films, track what you’ve watched, and decide what to watch next.
    </p>

    <p class="lead text-center mt-3">
        QuickFlicks brings all your watchlists together in one place. Streaming
        platforms often keep their own separate lists, which makes it easy to lose
        track of what you wanted to watch. QuickFlicks keeps everything organised
        into simple shelves so you always know what's next.
    </p>

    <p class="lead text-center mt-3">
        Movies are supported right now, with space for series to be added in the future.
    </P>
