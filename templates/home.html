{% extends "base.html" %}
{# 
    This template extends the global base layout.
    By inheriting from base.html, we automatically get the navbar, footer,
    Bootstrap styling and overall page structure without repeating code.
#}

{% block content %}
{# 
    The block below replaces the {% block content %} section inside base.html.
    Django takes the contents of this block and injects it into the main area
    defined in the parent template.
#}

    <h1>Welcome to QuickFlicks</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Your place to track movies, shelves and what to watch next.
    </p>

{# End of page-specific content block #}
