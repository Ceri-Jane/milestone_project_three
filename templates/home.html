{% extends "base.html" %}
{# 
    This template extends the global base layout.
    By inheriting from base.html, we automatically get the navbar, footer,
    Bootstrap styling and overall page structure without repeating code.
#}

{% block content %}
{# 
    This block replaces the main content area defined in base.html.
    Django injects everything inside this block into the template.
#}

<h1>Welcome to QuickFlicks</h1>
<p class="lead">
    Your place to track movies, shelves and what to watch next.
</p>
