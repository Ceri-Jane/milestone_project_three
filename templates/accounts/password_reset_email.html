Hi {{ user.username }},

You requested a password reset for your QuickFlicks account.

Below is your secure password reset link.  
Screen readers will read the full URL out loud so users can confirm it's correct:

{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If you didn’t request this, you can safely ignore this email.
Your password will remain unchanged unless you use the link above.

Thanks,  
QuickFlicks Team
